# VolumeChanger
Small repo for a multipurpose windows 10 volume changer.
Program SoundVolumeView.exe is used in order to change the volume levels of applications.
The .cmd are specificly setup for discord volume but can be changed for anything program you desire.
Personally I use this personally use this to alter discord volume and bound it via iCUE software to a scroll wheel on my keyboard.
Nirsoft SoundVolumeView.exe offers alot of other Windows volume control if you would like to make a solution for you own problem.

### setup

In order for this to work first go to website of Nirsoft and download SoundVolumeView.exe
> http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/sound_volume_view.html

Unzip the file and place it somewhere on your computer.
Then add the program folder to your system path (can be skipped, but in this case the path of program needs to be added to volume changer files.)
Reboot in order for the system variable to work.
Clone the volume changer files to you prefered location and your ready to go.
