# VolumeChanger
Small repo for a multipurpose windows 10 volume changer.
Program SoundVolumeView.exe is used in order to change the volume levels of applications.
The batch (.bat) files are specifically setup for discord volume but can be changed for any other program.
Personally I use this to alter my discord volume and bound it via iCUE software to a scroll wheel on my keyboard.
To change the volume Nirsoft NirCMD.exe tool is used. The software offers a lot more command line control for you windows system.

### setup

In order for this to work first go to website of Nirsoft and download the NirCMD tool at the bottom of the page
> https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html

Unzip the file and place it in your preferred location on your computer.
Then add the program folder to your system path, as an alternative you can directly write the path inside of the two .bat files.
If chosen to add the path to system variables your PC needs to be restarted in order for the variable to update.
Clone the volume changer files to you preferred location, bind them to a key and your ready to go.
